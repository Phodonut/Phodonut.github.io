    <p>-&emsp; Mission: Design a game with a team from conception to shipped product.
    <p>-&emsp; Summary: Shroommates is a third-person platformer where players play as a sentient mushroom trying to return to his family. Jump, glide, run, and collect items around the house while completing various objectives from room to room! Make sure to avoid the humans! Will you be able to find the deed to the house and kick out the humans?
    <p>-&emsp; Length: ~20 weeks </p>
    <p>-&emsp; Team Size:  15 </p>
    <p>-&emsp; Platform/Language: UE4/C++, designed for controllers such as xbox mainly.
    <p>-&emsp; Main Contributions: <br>&emsp; <b>Player Camera</b>: A setup both working when an experienced player is deliberately controlling the camera as well as when an inexperienced player never deliberately moves the camera. Focuses on key elements, moves based on the current location to guide the player and avoid bumping into walls etc... <br> &emsp;  <b>Animation Programming</b>: (Similar workflow to a technical artist) All animations were created in blender and passed to me, so my job was to define the 'import and use' flow from blender to UE4 as well as create and mantain animation blendstates and trees, adjusting them in engine to fit the needs of the game.</p>
